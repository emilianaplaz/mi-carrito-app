# Mi Carrito App

## Working towards enhancing food accessibility in Venezuela!

MiCarrito is an app that creates personalized meal plans tailored to dietary preferences and local ingredient availability. It auto-generates shopping lists and compares prices with local supermarkets, ensuring users make informed, budget-friendly choices. Designed for health-conscious individuals and families with tighter budgets in the venezuelan economy, MiCarrito simplifies meal planning and grocery shopping, promoting more optimized shopping habits. 

This app was developed during a **hackathon** in Venezuela, where innovation and collaboration came together to address local challenges. It aims to provide practical solutions that resonate with the unique needs of our communities.
